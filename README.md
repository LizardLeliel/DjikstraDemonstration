Runtime Graph Redux
===================

A very simple program, designed not for pratical application but for practice... And fun.

It stores user-generated discrete graphs at run-time, inputted through standard input. Users will be able to add nodes, adjust their distances, see which which node is connected to which node, and remove them, and find shortest distances to various nodes

It is a redo of my Runtime Graph project; except redone in pure C
